They will have 36 hours to apply their quantitative skills to analyze the dataset and tackle an industry problem. Though the competition is the core event of the Datathon, there will also be fun workshops presented from professionals in the field and an informal career fair. So come learn how to apply analytical skills learned in the classroom to real-life data!"
